#  ====
#  i-PI
#  ====
# 
#  A Python interface for ab initio path integral molecular dynamics simulations.
#  i-PI is composed of a Python server (i-pi itself, that does not need to be
#  compiled but only requires a relatively recent version of Python and Numpy)
#  that propagates the (path integral) dynamics of the nuclei, and of an external
#  code that acts as a client and computes the electronic energy and forces.
#  
#  This is typically a patched version of an electronic structure code, but a
#  simple self-contained Fortran driver that implements Lennard-Jones and
#  Silvera-Goldman potentials is included for test purposes.
